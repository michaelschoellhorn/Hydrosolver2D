# Hydrosolver2D
This code is meant to solve the 2D euler equations for arbituary starting distributions and periodic boundary conditions. It uses a dimensionally split finite volume approach on a fixed grid and solves advection and source terms seperatly. For the advection step one can chosse different flux functions implemented in flux.h.
